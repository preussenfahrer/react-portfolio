# Portfolio with React

## My Portfolio
Thanks for taking the chance to look at my refactored Portfolio with React. I hope you enjoy the progress I've managed to make in nearly 12 weeks of learning Full Stack Web Development! 

Below, you will see the instructions for how to render this portfolio on your local machine: 


In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
